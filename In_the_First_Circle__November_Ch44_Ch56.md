### Chapter 53 The Ark

Prisoners in the sharashka are forced into a period of "rest" on Sunday evenings due to the free workers' schedule. Despite the harsh conditions and lack of amenities, this time of complete isolation and detachment from the outside world is paradoxically perceived by the inmates as a unique form of freedom and inner liberation. The prison itself is likened to an "ark" floating through an ocean of human destinies.

#### Summary

*   Prisoners are forced to stop work at 6:00 P.M. on Sundays, a mandatory interruption due to the free workers' schedule that authorities cannot change.

*   Sunday leisure activities are severely restricted: no exercise, films, or musical instruments are allowed, with even homemade instruments actively sought out by operations officers.
*   The prison library, with its limited and undesirable collection, is managed by prisoner Rubin, but inmates often seek reading material from female free workers.
*   During their "rest," prisoners gain the freedom to lie on beds, move freely, smoke, argue, and use the bathroom without permission, considering this a significant personal liberty.
*   The prison building is metaphorically described as an "ark," isolating its occupants from all external events and the usual worries of the world until morning.
*   Inside the "ark," prisoners experience a "weightless" existence, detached from worldly concerns, career struggles, or family worries, fostering deep friendship and philosophical thought.

### Chapter 54 Leisure Amusements

The inmates of the sharashka gather for their evening leisure in a communal room, engaging in various activities. Isaak Kagan urges the witty Lev Rubin to entertain the group, and Rubin eventually agrees to stage a mock trial, assigning roles to his fellow prisoners.

#### Characters

#### Summary

*   Twenty-five inmates assemble in the semicircular room at six o'clock, enjoying their leisure time after work.
*   Isaak Kagan persistently badgered Lev Grigorievich Rubin to provide entertainment, recalling Rubin's popular "Crow and Fox" skit.
*   Rubin, initially reluctant due to previous trouble, decides to entertain the group by staging a "modest trial" to begin the evening.

### Chapter 55 Prince Igor

A group of prisoners in a Soviet gulag hold a mock trial for the historical figure Prince Igor, using Soviet legal and ideological frameworks to accuse him of treason and collaboration with the Polovtsians. The "prosecutors" creatively re-interpret historical accounts and works of art to build a case, mirroring the unjust trials faced by the prisoners themselves.

#### Characters

*   **Rubin:** A prisoner acting as the eloquent chief prosecutor, presenting a detailed, anachronistic indictment against Prince Igor.
*   **Prince Igor Svyatoslavich Olgovich:** The historical figure on trial, accused of treason, espionage, and collaboration with the Polovtsians.
*   **Nerzhin:** A prisoner overseeing the mock trial, who encourages the prosecution and its procedural breaches.
*   **Spiridon:** An older Russian prisoner who identifies with Prince Igor's plight, recognizing the unfairness of the prosecutor's arguments.
*   **Isaak Kagan:** A prisoner who challenges the prosecutor's anachronisms and later offers a "defense" by suggesting an even more severe, bizarre sentence.

*   **Khan Konchak:** The Polovtsian leader, presented by the prosecution as Prince Igor's long-term ally and co-conspirator.

#### Summary

*   Rubin, acting as prosecutor, presents a detailed indictment against Prince Igor, accusing him of treason for voluntarily surrendering to Khan Konchak with his army and showing no leadership.
*   Rubin asserts Igor's treasonous conduct included being deceived by an eclipse and being selfishly preoccupied with his wife, Yaroslavna, while in "privileged" captivity.
*   Professor Chelnov supplements the prosecution, revealing Igor's Polovtsian maternal heritage, his prior alliances with Konchak, and his son Vladimir's betrothal to Konchak's daughter, as further proof of long-term betrayal.
*   Rubin demands a 25-year sentence for Igor, a ban on Borodin's opera *Prince Igor*, and the arrest or accountability of several historical and artistic figures associated with the story.
*   Isaak Kagan, initially questioning the prosecutor, later proposes a "defense" that ironically suggests an even harsher, non-existent punishment for Igor: "spiritual castration" and expulsion from the USSR.
*   The prisoners react with a mix of laughter and a grim recognition of the parallels between the mock trial's injustices and their own experiences under the Soviet regime.

### Chapter 56 Winding Up the Twentieth

This chapter focuses on Abramson, an old and cynical political prisoner, who reflects on his past and current imprisonment with indifference, contrasting his "titan" generation with later streams of zeks. He recalls a fervent 1929 exiles' conference before being drawn back to his present by Nerzhin, who invites him to a birthday party and critiques his choice of reading material.

*   After his initial ten-year sentence, Abramson was briefly released and reunited with his family before being re-arrested and sentenced to another decade for the same past offenses.
*   Abramson reunites with Nerzhin and Potapov in the Marfino sharashka, feeling that his life as a free man was merely a cruel dream and prison his only concrete reality.
*   Nerzhin invites a reluctant Abramson to his birthday party, which Abramson accepts, anticipating another futile political argument.
*   Nerzhin critiques Abramson's book, *The Count of Monte Cristo*, stating its portrayal of prison is unrealistic due to a lack of security procedures compared to real-world prisons.
