# 2004 CRV Cheat Sheet

## Warning Lights and Sounds

### "Lights On" and "Key in Ignition" warnings

"**Lights On**" and "**Key in Ignition**" warnings no longer work.  You will get no beep or buzz or other reminder if you leave the lights on or key in the car.  It is very easy to lock yourself out and/or become stranded with a dead battery.

To help with battery issue, I've installed a battery saver which monitors the voltage and will disconnect the battery before it completely discharges.   See window decal in the upper left of the windshield.

### "Check Engine" light 

"**Check Engine**" light has been on for years.  Catalytic converter oxygen sensor and/or wiring is bad.  Chatham County doesn't care, so neither do I.

## Sunroof -- Do not open

Do not open!  Seals are dry-rotted.  It is currently not leaking.  If you open it, that will change.

## Smoke & Air Fresheners -- Please don't

Cloth seats and carpet absorb smoke and the smell lasts forever.

I don't care what you smoke -- tobacco, weed, opium, crack -- but ***please*** do it outside the CRV.  Gas station air fresheners are just as bad.  I know the CRV might not be fresh and new, but we're used to each other.

## Door Locks -- some work

Some of the door lock solenoids work and some do not.  When you lock the vehicle, you need to walk around, check and manually lock the front passenger and one of the back doors.

## Radio

The radio works, but DVD player does not.  Cassette player *might* work, but I haven't tried it in years.

## Registration & Inspection

Up-to-date NC Registration and Inspection documents are in a red plastic folder in the glove compartment
